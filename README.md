# Kubernetes
Getting familiar with Kubernetes

This is probably the premiere ___Orchestration framework___ for the __Cloud__.

There are 3 main tools, __kubeadm__, __kubectl__, and __minikube__.

Using __minikube__ probably requires enabling either __VT-x__ or __AMD-v__ hardware virtualization in your __BIOS__.

[In my BIOS this was __Advanced__ -> __CPU Configuration__ -> __Intel Virtualization Technology__]
