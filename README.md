# Getting familiar with Kubernetes

## Introduction

[Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) is probably the premiere ___Orchestration framework___ for the __Cloud__.

[For a short overview, the [Wikipedia article on Kubernetes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kubernetes) is pretty good.]

As of August, 2017 all of the major cloud providers belong to the [Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF)](https://www.cncf.io/)
which supports Kubernetes. In fact, Kubernetes was the first project to _graduate_ from the CNCF, in March 2018.

The main cloud providers (AWS, Azure, GCP) all support Kubernetes (generally as a premium offering).

[As Google had already used GCE for their compute engine, their container TLA is __GKE__.]

[For those who like such terms, Kubernetes is a ___PaaS___ (Platform as a Service).]

## Thoughts on the best cloud provider

There's an old photography joke about what the best camera is: "the one you have with you" (the one at home is no use).

Likewise, the best cloud provider is whichever one you know best.

They _all_ have huge eco-systems so learning each providers set of offerings is definitely a non-trivial exercise.

My read on things is that __AWS__ is the leader and likely to stay that way; __Azure__ is the corporate choice for
the MS world; and __GCP__ is a late-comer (in terms of commercial offerings) but cannot be discounted (or ignored).
For one thing, the presence of GCP has led everyone to discount their prices (which is probably not a bad thing).

So in the end overall cost is probably not a good criterion as charges are likely to continue to go down.

[UPDATE: For probably much the same reasons as Amazon (their customers were already running it on their hardware),
 Digital Ocean are getting into the Kubernetes market. DO announced their upcoming Early Access Program im May, 2018
 with clusters free through September 2018. DO also upgraded their CNCF membership from Silver to Gold.]

#### AWS

It does not seem to be that easy to create a __Kubernetes__ cluster with AWS. While there are [kops](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops)
and [kube-aws](https://github.com/kubernetes-incubator/kube-aws), which seem to be actively supported and full-featured, it is a concern
that there is no AWS-native tooling. This situation may improve now that Amazon has joined the
[Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF)](https://www.cncf.io/) - or it may not. Amazon's intentions are not clear but their Adrian Cockcroft
has expressed interest in [Containerd](https://containerd.io/) and [Linkerd](https://linkerd.io/) (Linkerd is a _service mesh_, much like
[Istio](https://istio.io/)). Plus they seem to be experimenting with [kops](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/kubernetes-clusters-aws-kops/).

Amazon of course have their own [ECS (EC2 Container Service)](https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/) which uses different terminology than Kubernetes
(for instance I believe a __task__ approximates to a __pod__) but largely offers the same sorts of services.

However according to the CNCF the bulk of AWS customers appear to have opted for Kubernetes over ECS:

[Apparently 63 percent of Kubernetes workloads run on AWS.]

While the Amazon ECS offering can be expected to continue to evolve, they also seem to be hedging their bets with Kubernetes.

UPDATE: As of November 29, 2017 Amazon announced their new Containers-as-a-Service service
[Fargate](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2017/11/introducing-aws-fargate-a-technology-to-run-containers-without-managing-infrastructure/)
as well as their new managed Kubernetes offering
[Amazon Elastic Container Service for Kubernetes](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/) (for which the TLA is EKS).
It's probably too early to say what these services offer over and above what was previously offered, but it
does seem to be proof that Amazon Marketing likes the Kubernetes brand. Fargate, at least, looks like a product
that will really appeal to the ML (Machine learning) crowd.

#### Azure and Firefox

If you use __firefox__ as your browser, you will need to add a popup exception for __portal.azure.com__ to allow it to open pop-up windows,
otherwise Azure's Cloud Shell window will not open (I have left feedback so perhaps this will be fixed). It does not seem to be possible
to paste into the Cloud Shell window either, which is annoying.

## Running in the Cloud versus running locally

The cloud providers listed all provide either free credits or free services (presumably for evaluation purposes).
The charges for cloud services are likely to continue to go down.

They all require a valid credit card too (presumably for identification/authentication/idemnification purposes).

So tread carefully: some of the allocation settings are not set __by default__ to the free tier offerings.

[Generally the ___free___ offerings are limited to the 'micro' or 'small' machine images.]

Premium products (such as Google's Cloud Spanner - which is pretty cool) are generally not free.

Using these will eat into your free credits, so remember to tear everything down when finished.

As with __Docker__ it is possible to run __Kubernetes__ locally, which definitely has some advantages.

For one thing, all of the cloud providers have extensive (and very cluttered) dashboards whereas the command <kbd>minikube dashboard</kbd>
will pop open a browser populated with a much less cluttered dashboard (making it much easier to see what is going on).

## Tools

![minikube logo with name](./minikube_logo_with_name.svg)

There are 3 main tools: `kubeadm`, `kubectl`, and `minikube`.

For setting up local clusters or for provisioning VMs, `kubeadm` is probably useful.

[If you go this route, make sure to use your *best* machine for the __master__ node,
as it is a single point of failure (multi-master clusters *may* be in the works but
are not yet a reality as of Kubernetes 1.8). If the `etcd` on the master node
breaks, not much else will work properly either. You should probably back up this
`etcd` on a regular basis too. Maybe with a Kubernetes cronjob.]

However, for most purposes - including dealing with cloud providers (such as AWS, Azure,
GCP, etc) - `kubeadm` is probably not necessary. It seems to be more of an installation
and administration tool.

Having dabbled with all 3 of the listed providers, I can confirm that it is not necessary to install `kubectl` locally either.

[Each of the cloud providers recommends that you install their CLI (or command-line toolset),
which definitely makes a lot of things simpler, however it ___should___ be possible to perform
all needed functions from a web interface (navigating said dashboard is generally non-trivial
however). When operating in the cloud you will use a provided `kubectl`, so generally no need
to have it installed locally.]

For local familiarization, `minikube` is the way to go - and it requires `kubectl`.

[`minikube` is really the local equivalent of a cloud provider's command-line toolset.]

Using `minikube` also requires installing some form of virtualization; for linux either __VirtualBox__ or __KVM__ [I chose VirtualBox].

Using either of these probably requires enabling either __VT-x__ or __AMD-v__ hardware virtualization in your __BIOS__.

[Don't worry, the minikube startup process will tell you if this setting needs to be enabled or not. Hopefully not.]

[In my BIOS this was __Advanced__ -> __CPU Configuration__ -> __Intel Virtualization Technology__]

## My Projects

These are not in the same order that I went through them, as I progressed I had to backtrack from time to time (when I needed a
better grounding on basic concepts) but the order below corresponds to what I think is the difficulty level; in other words the
order presented is the order to follow.

These all require `kubectl` and `minikube`.
